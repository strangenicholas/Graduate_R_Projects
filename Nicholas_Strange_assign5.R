# Predicting crashes in the stock market is notoriously difficult. Based on the mret7018 data
# set, construct a variable CRASH equal to 1 if the return of a stock in a given month is less
# than –8% (–0.08), and equal to 0, otherwise. Build a predictive model of CRASH based on
# the stock market variables in the data set. To reduce computational time, focus on the last
# 5 years of data.
# Make sure that all predictive variables are lagged (1,2,3,.. months), so that this is indeed a
# predictive model. Select the variables carefully. Some possible predictors include past
# returns, absolute values of returns (volatility), market caps, turnover (trading volume/shares outstanding), 
# etc. You could also use interactions of some of the predictors.
# Explore different predictive variables and models, as discussed in this chapter. What is the
# best AUC that your model achieves? Summarize your best model in a short write up and
# email to me both the R-code and the write up.
