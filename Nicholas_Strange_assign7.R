# The file nj2000.sas7bdat contains variables for a sample of household
# heads from the state of NJ. Definitions of the variables could be found in the file nj2000_var. 
  #Based on this information:
# 1. Filter out observations for the Philadelphia, PA/NJ metropolitan area (METAREA = 616)
# 2. Using the variable OWNERSHIP, construct a variable equal to 1 for owning a home, vs. 0 for renting
# 3. Predict homeownership based on the available variables and your knowledge acquired in class. 
  # Pick up your best model based on AUC. Describe the model.
